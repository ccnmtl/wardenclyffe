Wardenclyffe has detected {{cnt}} operation{{cnt|pluralize}} that {% if mcnt %}have{% else %}has{% endif %} taken over an hour to
complete.

This may indicate a problem or just an unusually high workload. Either way,

Wardenclyffe will continue sending these emails hourly as long as there are
any slow operations detected, so remember to clear out fixed or
permanently broken ones.
